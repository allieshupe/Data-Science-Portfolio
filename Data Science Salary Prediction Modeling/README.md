Data Science Salary Prediction Modeling

This project analyzes and creates a predictive model for data science salaries. The data comes from Kaggle, but can also be accessed through the ds_salaries.csv file found in this folder. The Jupyter notebook containing the code for the analysis and model can be found in the Salary_Code.ipynb file in this folder.

If you have any questions, please contact Allie Shupe.
