In-Patient Claims Modeling

The project analyzes and models in-patient claims data from the Centers for Medicaid and Medicare. In addition to being able to access the data on CMS's website, you can also access it in the CMS_Inpatient_Claims.csv file found in this folder. The analysis is contained in the Claims_Code.ipynb file which contains a Jupyter notebook.

If you have any questions, please contact Allie Shupe.
