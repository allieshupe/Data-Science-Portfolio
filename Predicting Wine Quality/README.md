Predicting Time to Adoption at Animal Shelter

The project creates a model that can be used to predict the quality rating of any given wine using variables such as pH, alcohol content, density, etc. The data comes from Kaggle and can be accessed here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajyellow46/wine-quality. It can also be accessed through the wine.csv file in this folder. A Jupyter notebook was used to conduct the analysis and create the model. It can be accessed in this folder as the "WineQuality_Code.ipynb" file.
