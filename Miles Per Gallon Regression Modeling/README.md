Miles Per Gallon Regression Model

In this analysis, two models are fit to a dataset containing information on various makes and models of cars in order to predict their MPG. The data is the contained in the "auto-mpg.csv" filed in this folder. A Random Forest Regression model and a Linear Regression model were both fit to the data and analyzed to determine which performs the best. The analysis is found in a Jupyter notebook labeled "MPG_Code.ipynb" in this folder.
