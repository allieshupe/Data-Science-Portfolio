Predicting Time to Adoption at Animal Shelter

The project creates a model that can be used to predict the number of days it will take for an animal to be adopted from the shelter based on factors such as species, age, breed, and other descriptive characteristics. The data comes from the Sonoma County Animal Shelter and can be accessed at this link: https://data.sonomacounty.ca.gov/Government/Animal-Shelter-Intake-and-Outcome/924a-vesw/about_data. A Jupyter notebook was used to conduct the analysis and create the model. It can be accessed in this folder as the "AdoptionPrediction_Code.ipynb" file.
