#  Data Science Portfolio #

This repository is a collection of data science projects which I have completed. Below is a brief description of each project.

1.	Rideshare Pricing Analysis. The purpose of this analysis was to explore the relationship between rideshare fares and the date, length, and distance of the ride. This analysis could be used to then determine the most cost-efficient way to use a rideshare.
2.	Hotel Cancelations with Predictive Analytics. In this project, I analyzed a dataset from Kaggle that contains hotel bookings between 2015 and 2017 to predict whether a booking will be canceled by the customer in advance of the stay.
3.	Miles Per Gallon Regression Modeling. This project uses two regression models to predict the miles per gallon rating for a car in the given data set. It highlights training, testing, and comparing the models.
4.	Correlation of Netflix’s Stock Price with Releases. The purpose of this project was to analyze the correlation between Netflix’s stock price with large new releases on the platform. It showcases extensive data preparation, data joins, and EDA.
5.	Sentiment Analysis Using Movie Reviews. This project uses sentiment analysis to determine if a movie review was positive, negative, or neutral. It showcases in-depth text analysis that is not seen in any of the other projects.
6.	Interactive Weather Code. This Python code pulls and displays the weather of a user-given United States city using data from an API. It highlights proficiency in Python coding, along with demonstrating an emphasis on code comments and documentation.
7.	Predicting Time to Adoption at Animal Shelter. This project uses predictive analytics to model the length of time it will take for an animal to be adopted from the Sonoma County Animal Shelter. It demonstrates proficiency in advanced modeling techniques.
8.	Applied Data Science Project 1 (Predicting Data Science Salaries). This project uses regression modeling to predict salaries in the data science field. It will showcase a real-world application of EDA, data preparation, and modeling.
9.	Applied Data Science Project 2 (TBD).
10.	Applied Data Science Project 3 (TBD).
