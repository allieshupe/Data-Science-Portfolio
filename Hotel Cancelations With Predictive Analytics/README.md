# Hotel Cancelations with Predictive Analytics #

For this project, I will be analyzing a dataset from Kaggle that contains hotel bookings between 2015 and 2017 to predict whether a booking will be canceled by the customer in advance of the stay. The data can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/khairullahhamsafar/hotels-booking-data-cleaned-version. It is also saved as “hotel_booking_data_cleaned.csv” in this folder. While the dataset contains data from dozens of countries, it will be filtered to only include bookings at US hotels. A few key independent variables in the data are the lead time of the reservation, length of the reservation, and if the reservation required a deposit. These, along with a few others, will be used to predict the binary cancelation variable. A classification model will be used to predict if a booking will result in a cancelation. Please navigate to the “HotelCancelation_Code.ipynb” file to see the Jupyter notebook containing the code and output for this analysis.

If you encounter any issues with the code or have questions, please contact the author, Allie Shupe.
