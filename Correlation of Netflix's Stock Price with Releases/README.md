Correlation of Netflix's Stock Price with Releases

For this project, I analyzed the impact that releasing new movies and series has on Netflix's stock price.. The data can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/syedmubarak/netflix-dataset-latest-2021. It is also saved as “Netflix Dataset Latest 2021.csv” in this folder. This source (a .csv file at the bottom of the link above) displays each new release on Netflix. Though this dataset has 29 columns, the columns that will be of most use to this analysis will be the title, series or movie, boxoffice, date added, and view rating. Please navigate to the “NetflixStock_Code.ipynb” file to see the Jupyter notebook containing the code and output for this analysis.

If you encounter any issues with the code or have questions, please contact the author, Allie Shupe.
