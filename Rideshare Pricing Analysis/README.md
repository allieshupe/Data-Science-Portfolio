Rideshare Pricing Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to explore the relationship between rideshare fares and the date, length, and distance of the ride. This analysis can then be used to determine the most cost-efficient way to use a rideshare. The data set used for this project comes from the City of Chicago’s publicly available database and contains records on all rideshares taken in the city during the last week of May 2023. Exploratory data analysis, data preparation, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing are conducted in this analysis. Please navigate to the “Rideshare_Code.ipynb” file in this folder to view the code and output.

If you encounter any issues with the code or have questions, please contact the author, Allie Shupe.
